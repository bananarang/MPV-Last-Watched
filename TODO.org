* TODO
- Test most recent changes didn't break shit.
- Make it check episode count, and only increment the last_watched if it's actually higher.

- Perhaps add an option for a per episode file, or one large file in the mpv home folder, perhaps add a appropriate arg for mpv, so like
#+BEGIN_SRC 
mpv --lastwatched

Found X matches
Match 0
Match 1
Match ...

#+END_SRC
- Use the property media-title
  [[http://mpv.io/manual/master/#property-list]]
  
- Add launch option to start mpv, and open current episode. (Would only work folders with only one show.)
